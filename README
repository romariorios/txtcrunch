txtcrunch is a compressed text format. This README gives its official
description -- if there's any difference between this document and the
implementation, it is, a priori, a bug in the implementation.

A txtcrunch text is divided in two sections:

 - Dictionary section, which lists all common terms used in the text
 - Text section, which contains normal texts and references to the dictionary

Each term in the dictionary section, with the exception of the last one, ends
with an unescaped number sign (#); the dictionary itself ends at the first
unescaped exclamation mark (!). In both sections, escaping is done by placing
a backslash at the left side of the character -- (for example: \!, \#, \\).
Exclamation marks don't need to be escaped in the text section.

Everything after the dictionary section is the text section. A reference to the
dictionary is denoted by an unescaped number sign, followed by a number (for
example: #3); the number after the number sign is the index of the term in the
dictionary, which is zero-indexed; to separate an index from a number following
it, the escaping character (i.e., \) should be used (for instance: #35\2452).
References that have out-of-range indexes or non-numeric contents (say, #blah)
should be kept as they are in the uncompressed text; valid references should be
replaced by their corresponding terms in the dictionary.

Any uncompression method that respects the rules above and produces plain text
is correct; any compression method that produces a valid txtcrunch text is also
correct.
